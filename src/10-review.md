# What happened so far?

This setup is the base for any other program with graphic output.

So far you have learned:

* how to install Rust and initialize a new Rust project with cargo.
* what a cargo manifest is, and how you can add dependencies.
* how to declare mutable and immutable variables and how to write functions.
* how to use two different types of loops and iterate over something.
* You got to know Rust's awesome error messages. 
* You know what an enum is and can use `match` for control flow. 
* You can look things up in the documentation. 
* You made your first experience in handling errors and took the first step to write a multithreaded program. 

Awesome!!!!
