# How to Continue from Here

Congratulations, if you made it this far!

You don't have a running snake game yet, but you learned almost everything you need to know to continue on your own.

Things you can do to continue:
* [Rusty-Snake](https://github.com/rustbridge/Rusty-Snake) contains a buggy but basically working game. Look at the code, improve it!
* Go to a local Rust MeetUp to get help or learn new things.
* Check out the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to learn more and get a deeper and systematic understanding of the language.
* Check out [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) that illustrates various Rust concepts with running code examples.
* Do [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.
* Become a RustBridge Teaching Assistant the next time! You don't need to understand everything and you can learn so much when you're explaining things to others.
